                        It is important for people to be able to protect themselves and those they care about, but it is also important to distinguish between self-defense and needless aggressiveness. Men should seek to develop a positive sense of self-esteem and assertiveness, as well as learn to regulate their emotions and communicate effectively. The goal should be to make the world a safer and more just place.
